The library provides access to the Plausible API from applications written in the PHP language. 
It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses.

## Requirements

PHP 7.4 and later.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require devarts/plausible-php
```

## Usage

Simple usage looks like:

``` php
$plausible = new Plausible\PlausibleAPI('{plausible_api_token}');

$timeseries = $plausible->getTimeseries('example.com', [
    'period' => Plausible\Support\Period::DAYS_30,
    'metrics' => Plausible\Support\Metric::create()
        ->add(Plausible\Support\Metric::BOUNCE_RATE)
        ->add(Plausible\Support\Metric::VISITORS)
        ->toString(),
    'filters' => Plausible\Support\Filter::create()
        ->add(Plausible\Support\Property::VISIT_SOURCE, 'Chrome', Plausible\Support\Filter::NOT_EQUAL)
        ->toString(),
]);

foreach ($timeseries as $timepoint) {
    echo "{$timepoint->date->format('Y-m-d')} | {$timepoint->bounce_rate} | {$timepoint->visitors}";
}
```
